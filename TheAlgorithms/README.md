	# Files inside this repo: 

 *This files includes a variety of Data Structures go ahead with them if you've visit the begginer's entry
 or if you fell comfortable with java as a whole, As always I'll re-write them, I'm still struggling to grasp Tress, Graphs And some about buffers maybe, with nothing more to add Enjoy it.

#Test 
**As you may could know now, all the stuff that you are going to develop needs be tested, because we don't want to know a week, month later when our minds almost forgot what it was, so give you a peacefully life an test 
and for all the community and do testing ;) .**

**The page that I would use as an online resource and suggest you to use as well it's :**
[JDOODLE](https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/)


*Anyways remember you could run them as well with an ide (netbeans, eclipse, jdeveloper, IntelliJ) if you're a student in the middle of a degree or just beginning you could ask for free license in almost all the idea created just a fact that maybe useful for yours ;) or just by using the classic commands*

*Important keep in mind that the class in the code and 'Class_file_name.java' needs to have the same name
and by convention Keep the first letter as Uppercase. In this case Class_file_name.java it will be compiled 
and Class_file_name.class will be generated, being these last files compiles one from the java file.*
```sh
javac  Class_file_name.java
```

*Important the Class_file_name doesn't need any extension to work properly. *
```sh
java  Class_file_name
```


*At this moment the files tested are :*
```sh
 root $ ECHO status_test = "NONE";

//I'm sorry when I finished to upload all the code I'll begin
none. 
```
