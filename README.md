# Files inside this repo: 


These are a bunch of unrelated java classes destinated for really-beginners. 
The approach for this if you're a beginners searching for learn java it's writting them
and at the same time try to think why are they made for.

# Suggest
 Try playing some with the code, change variable's names, iterative cycles parameter, methods scopes and
 see how it breaks and try to fix that as well, all this progresively it will help you. 

Write code per block, taking a number of rows depending the complexity of the logic related and stop shortly if you feel you that neeed it. 


I will let the github repo from where they were recolected as a helper guide if you want to look at them or
give some stars to their creators, good look and welcome. 
 

Notes : Ayushd70 tends to write letters for variables when there's some logic involved that could be 
abstracted from parameters used.  All this adds complexity to I'll try to re-write them to make them more comfortable
for begginners. But still I'll let some between files to make you work out them ;).
