# Files inside this repo: 


They are a bunch of unrelated java classes destinated for really beginners. 
The approach for them if you're a beginners searching for learn java it's writting them
and at the same time try to think why are they made for.

# Suggest
 Try to play some with the code, change variables name, iterative cycles parameters, methods scopes and
 see how it breaks and try to fix that as well, all this progresively it will help you. 

Write per block of code related and stop shortly if you feel you neeed it. 


I will let the github repo from where they were recolected as a helper guide if you want to look at them 




Notes : Ayushd70 tends to write letters for variables when there's some logic involved that could be 
abstracted from parameters used.
