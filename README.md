# Files inside this repo: 


These are a bunch of unrelated java classes destinated for really-beginners. 
The approach for this if you're a beginners searching for learn java it's writting them
and at the same time try to think why are they made for.

# Suggestion
 Try playing some with the code, change variable's names, iterative cycles parameter, methods scopes and
 see how it breaks and try to fix that as well, all this progresively it will help you. 

Write code per block, taking a number of rows depending the complexity of the logic related and stop shortly if you feel you that neeed it. 


I will let the github repo from where they were recolected as a helper guide if you want to look at them or
give some stars to their creators, good look and welcome. 
 

Notes : Ayushd70 tends to write letters for variables when there's some logic involved that could be 
abstracted from parameters used.  All this adds complexity to I'll try to re-write them to make them more comfortable
for begginners. But still I'll let some between files to make you work out them ;).


## Test

**As you may could know now, all the stuff that you are going to develop needs be tested, because we don't want to know a week, month later when our minds almost forgot what it was, so give you a peacefully life an test 
and for all the community and do testing ;) .**

**The page that I would use as an online resource and suggest you to use as well it's :**
[JDOODLE](https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/)


*Anyways remember you could run them as well with an ide (netbeans, eclipse, jdeveloper, IntelliJ) if you're a student in the middle of a degree or just beginning you could ask for free license in almost all the ides created just a fact that maybe useful for yours ;) or just by using the classic commands*

*Important keep in mind that the class in the code and 'Class_file_name.java' needs to have the same name
and by convention Keep the first letter as Uppercase. In this case Class_file_name.java it will be compiled 
and Class_file_name.class will be generated, being these last files compiles one from the java file.*

```sh
javac  Class_file_name.java
```

*Important the Class_file_name doesn't need any extension to work properly.*
```sh
java  Class_file_name
```

*At this moment the files tested are :*
```sh
 root $ ECHO status_test = "NONE";

//I'm sorry when I finished to upload all the code I'll begin
none. 
```
